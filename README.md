**Deprecation Warning**

Textile Threads v1 are being deprecated. Please follow our ongoing work on v2 on both the [go-textile-threads repo](https://github.com/textileio/go-textile-threads) and the [early preview](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Threads-v2-Early-Preview-X8fKsMiTyztuQ1L8CnUng). 

Until Threads v2 release and integration into the React Native SDK, this repo should be used for experimental purposes only.

For instructions on running the v2 delopment library in React Native, [see here](https://github.com/textileio/js-threads-client/#react-native).
