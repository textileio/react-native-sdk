The React Native SDK wraps Textile's mobile framework (generated by the [textile-go](https://github.com/textileio/textile-go/) library), which includes the Textile Node running [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) and the Textile APIs for easily managing on device data and content addressable data through the stack of IPFS protocols.

The SDK is meant to be a powerful set of tools for building consumer mobile applications on top of IPFS. It abstracts some of the core concepts related to using IPFS and other decentralized technologies, including

- Building content addressable data into production application
- Encrypting and storing data on your user's behalf
- Allowing users to share, message, or collaborate over permissioned channels
- Cache or store securely encrypted data offline
- Handling of p2p transmissions in mobile environments
